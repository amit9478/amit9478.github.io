          She believes every day is new & can be best utilized if something more can be done with it. Being a Delhi-ite, she spent most of her childhood being enjoying the city life & being confused about what she wanted to become, she eventually realized that she had a passion for “all-things” design. Few years later, she landed in National Institute of Design, graduating from which, she found her way into the Design pavilion of digital world. She is a lover of simple, effective designs & is definitely not a lover of non-fiction books.
          She has a zest to create an environment where she and team can innovate and achieve their best. She creates great experiences working collaboratively with fellow team members to conceptualize, design and prototype ideas to design user friendly products.

          If you don't have the time to read, you don't have the time to think or Design. This being the motto of his life, he never reads to amuse himself, but he reads to Design & Live. For him, everything around him is worthy of analysing, and then mentally re-framing it to make it simple & tasteful.
        </br>
          Amit is a ‘Thinker’ and ‘Innovator’ keeping himself updated with latest trends in market. His approach to Design is always at a strategy level, which speaks of his matured thinking. He has the knack of leveraging available insights like market analysis, customer feedback, site metrics, and usability findings and use these in solving design problems.
        </br>
          After he has worked for many hours straight, he does not think of hitting the sack; - rather one will shot of ‘biking around the town’ is enough to get him plugged for another day’s work.
